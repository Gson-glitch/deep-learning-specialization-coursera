## 📚 About the Specialization

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program designed to build strong theoretical and practical understanding of deep learning.

Throughout this program, I will:

- Build and train deep neural networks
- Apply best practices for model optimization
- Implement CNNs for computer vision
- Build RNNs and Transformers for NLP tasks
- Use tools like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and HuggingFace

Key concepts include:
- Forward and backward propagation
- Regularization (L2, Dropout)
- Batch Normalization
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Optimization algorithms (Momentum, RMSprop, Adam)
- Transfer learning
- CNN architectures (ResNets, etc.)
- RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs
- Transformers
